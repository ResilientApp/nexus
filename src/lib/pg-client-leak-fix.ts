// Runtime patch to prevent MaxListenersExceededWarning on pg Client instances
// Inspired by understanding of EventEmitter leak warnings and pg pool behaviour.
// The pool attaches a new 'end' listener to the same client every time it is
// checked out with pool.connect(). Over time this exceeds the default limit (10)
// and Node prints a warning. We keep only the most recent listener in place.

import { EventEmitter } from "events";
import { Client, Pool } from "pg";

// Patch Pool.prototype.connect so that after a client is checked out we
// de-duplicate the 'end' listeners that have accumulated on the client.
const originalConnect: (this: Pool, ...args: any[]) => Promise<Client> = (Pool as any).prototype.connect;

(Pool as any).prototype.connect = async function patchedConnect(this: Pool, ...args: any[]): Promise<Client> {

  // Only touch EventEmitter listeners if we are dealing with a pg Client
  // and there is more than one 'end' listener attached.
  const endListeners = (client as unknown as EventEmitter)?.listeners("end") || [];
  if (endListeners.length > 1) {
    // Keep the most recently attached listener (the last in the array) and
    // remove the earlier ones. This preserves pool's current release handler
    // while discarding the obsolete duplicates responsible for the warning.
    const listenersToRemove = endListeners.slice(0, -1);
    listenersToRemove.forEach((l) => {
      (client as unknown as EventEmitter).removeListener("end", l as (...args: any[]) => void);
